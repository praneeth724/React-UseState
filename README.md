In this quick demo, we explore the power of `useState` in React for managing state within functional components.

### Without `useState`:

- Using a normal variable, changes to state don't trigger re-renders.
- UI won't update to reflect state changes without manual intervention.

### With `useState`:

- React's `useState` hook enables easy state management within functional components.
- Updates trigger re-renders automatically, keeping the UI in sync with state changes.

## Benefits:

- Simplifies state management, especially in functional components.
- Encourages cleaner, more readable code.
- Automatic re-renders keep the UI responsive and up-to-date.

## Disadvantages:

- Can lead to excessive re-renders if not used carefully, impacting performance.

## Key Takeaway:

`useState` in React is a game-changer, offering a simple and effective way to manage state in functional components. Embrace it wisely to build more robust and efficient React applications!
